# Creating silicon lattice

Mathematica code which will create a silicon unit cell

## Instructions
* running mathematica code will output plot of unit cell of silicon to the directory in which this file is stored

## To Do
* Currently this is only a figure of the unit cell when completed should add to various other lattice calculations
